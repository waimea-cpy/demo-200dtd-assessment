# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **CAT SPOTTER**

Project Author: **Steve Copley**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Cat enthusiasts are always on the lookout for cats. They enjoy spotting them. However it is not easy to keep track of all the cat sightings since they often happen away from home. A system that helped cat spotters track their sightings would be useful.

### End-User Requirements

Cat enthusiasts come from all walks of life, and can be young or old. This means that any system must use clear and simple language, and be suitable for people of any age. It should be accessible in terms of colours and fonts used.

The level of IT expertise of the users could vary from high to very low. This means that the system must be very intuitive to use.

Cat spotters love cats, so the system should be nicely designed, possibly with a cat theme.

### Proposed Solution

A website / app that allows a cat spotter to easily record sightings of new cats, or of known cats. User should be able to:

- View a list of previous cats sighted
- View a list of previous cat sightings (organised by cat, or by date)
- Add a new cat to the system
- Add a sighting of a new cat to the system

Additionally, the system should:

- Be very simple to use
- Be accessible to all
- Be well designed and a pleasure to use
